PHYS 305: Computational Physics

This course focused on computational and numerical methods for data analysis, including the integration of ODEs and PDEs, finding roots, and least squares fitting. The course PHYS 305 is designed to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications.
This repository displays all my homework assignments and my final project from this course taken in Fall 2024.
